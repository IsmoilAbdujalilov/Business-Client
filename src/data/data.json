    "paragraph": "The story of BA’s birth is perhaps the most unusual of business stories you might have heard. It all began with a British guy taking a fortnight’s holiday in Uzbekistan where he met a fluent English speaking Uzbek guy and they hit it off instantly like two long lost brothers. When the British guy mentioned that he had five master’s degrees from five universities in five countries and that he had about 20 years’ experience working for 11 organisations in different roles, the Uzbek guy, having recently taken a startup project, inquired if the Brit could help him with creating a financial reporting regime for his startup.
